Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio---Update 

This weeks assignment had me updating my responsive portfolio with some of the work I have done the past 8 weeks and updating some of my professional websites.

I have added links to various assignments that I have completed as well as our group project. 
I have included screenshots and links to the repo's as well.

I have linked a resume from my google drive, updated my linkedIn, and updated my GitHub profile.

Feel free to check it all out!!!
